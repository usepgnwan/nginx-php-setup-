# pmcalculator üèóÔ∏è
A simple process manager calculator that helps determine the correct values for child processes in PHP-FPM.

# Usage :v:

To find the correct process manager values, you will have to measure how much memory the average process consumes. This may not always be possible unless the process uses very stable and repeating memory amounts. For environments with many different processes, such as shared hosting environments, it may be better to monitor  the processes, noting peaks every so often in order to calculate an average.
Using the process status (ps) command in Linux, sorting by RSS (Resident Set Size) to show the process with the highest memory usage first.

```bash
ps -ylC php-fpm --sort:rss
```

* The name php-fpm matches your process name. In many cases this will need to be changed to match the actual process such as php7.0-fpm.
* The column RSS contains the average memory usage in kilobytes per process.

```bash
S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI   RSS    SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
S     0 24439     1  0  80   0  6364 57236 -      ?        00:00:00 php-fpm
S    33 24701 24439  2  80   0 61588 63335 -      ?        00:04:07 php-fpm
S    33 25319 24439  2  80   0 61620 63314 -      ?        00:02:35 php-fpm
```

In this example 61588 kilobytes or converted about +- 60 Mb per process.
